# Recovers the sensor from a deep lock-up.
#
# After losing synchronisation — typically from protocol delays that were too
# short — the sensor ends up in a state where SHORT commands still go through
# (the firmware version reads back fine) but LONG transfers fail: the PSK read
# through 0xF2 in particular, so no TLS session can be established at all.
#
# Measured: neither the driver's reset pulse nor reopening the spidev node gets
# it out on its own. What matters is unbinding and rebinding the spidev kernel
# driver, whose state has to be reset. Holding the reset line down for a long
# time is not merely useless, it is counter-productive: recovery fails where a
# short pulse succeeds.
